Usage: ccs-findtemp < list_of_pathnames

This program reads list of pathnames from standard input and checks the existence of pathnames, and dumps the nonexistent pathnames.

The nonexistent pathnames are likely used as temporary pathnames. So find the naming rules from similar nonexistent pathnames and append the pattern to /etc/ccs/exception_policy.conf and /proc/ccs/exception_policy .

You can pass the content of /etc/ccs/domain_policy.conf or /proc/ccs/domain_policy using redirection or pipes to the standard input of this program.

Examples:

# ccs-findtemp < /proc/ccs/domain_policy
 Search for nonexistent pathnames from domain policy.
