Usage: ccs-patternize pattern [pattern ...] < list_of_pathnames > new_list_of_pathnames

This program reads domain policy from standard input and replaces pathnames with patterns if the pathname matches to patterns given at commandline and writes to standard output.

Pathnames that contains execute permission and domainnames won't be patterned.

Examples:

# ccs-patternize '/tmp/php\?\?\?\?\?\?' < /etc/ccs/domain_policy.conf > /etc/ccs/domain_policy2.conf
 Replace pathnames that matches to /tmp/php\?\?\?\?\?\? pattern.
