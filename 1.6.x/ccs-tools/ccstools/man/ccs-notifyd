Usage: ccs-notifyd timeout action

This program detects policy violation in enforcing mode and notify users (e.g. send a mail). You can know the first occurence of policy violation in enforcing mode as soon as possible. You may use this program for holding your judgement of the request that violates policy in enforcing mode provided that you can login to the system and start "ccs-queryd" command for responding within timeout seconds.

Examples:

# ccs-notifyd 180 'mail admin@example.com'
        Wait for 180 seconds before rejecting the request. The occurrence is notified by sending mail to admin@example.com (if SMTP service is available).

# ccs-notifyd 0 'curl --data-binary @- https://your.server/path_to_cgi'
        Reject the request immediately. The occurrence is notified by executing curl command.
