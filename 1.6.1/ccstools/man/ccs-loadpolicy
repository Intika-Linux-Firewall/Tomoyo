Usage: ccs-loadpolicy [-][s][e][d][a][f][p][m]

This program loads TOMOYO Linux's policy from files or standard input into kernel.

 -     Read policy from stdin. Specify only one of "sedpm" option when you use this option.

 s     Load system_policy. ( /etc/ccs/system_policy.conf )

 e     Load exception_policy. ( /etc/ccs/exception_policy.conf )

 d     Load domain_policy. ( /etc/ccs/domain_policy.conf )

 a     Load system_policy, exception_policy and domain_policy.

 p     Load profile. ( /etc/ccs/profile.conf )

 m     Load manager. ( /etc/ccs/manager.conf )

 f     Erase on-memory policy before loading on-disk policy. If not specified, on-disk policy is appended to on-memory policy.
       This option is valid for "seda" options.

Examples:

# echo "allow_read /proc/meminfo" | ccs-loadpolicy -e
 Add "allow_read /proc/meminfo" to exception policy.

# echo "delete allow_read /proc/meminfo" | ccs-loadpolicy -e
 Remove "allow_read /proc/meminfo" from exception policy.

# ( echo "<kernel>"; echo "1 /sbin/init" ) | ccs-loadpolicy -d
 Add "1 /sbin/init" to "<kernel>" domain.

# ccs-loadpolicy df
 Replace currently loaded domain policy with /etc/ccs/domain_policy.conf .

# ccs-loadpolicy d
 Append /etc/ccs/domain_policy.conf into currently loaded domain policy.
