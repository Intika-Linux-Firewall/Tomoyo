Usage: tomoyo-sortpolicy < domain_policy

This program reads domain policy from standard input and sort by domainnames and writes to standard output.
Same with sort(1) except that sorting is done domain by domain.

You can pass the content of /etc/tomoyo/domain_policy.conf or /sys/kernel/security/tomoyo/domain_policy using redirection or pipes to the standard input of this program.

Examples:

# tomoyo-sortpolicy < /sys/kernel/security/tomoyo/domain_policy
 Sort domain policy.
