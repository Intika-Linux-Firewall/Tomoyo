<h2><a name="general">General</a></h2>
<p>Q1: What is TOMOYO Linux?</p>
<p>A1: A Linux kernel that can automatically generate policies for Mandatory Access Control.</p>
<p>Q2: Who are the target users?</p>
<p>A2: Administrators who can't spend their energy for server security managements.</p>
<p>Q3: What are the target systems?</p>
<p>A3: Other than desktop use (i.e. servers and embedded systems).</p>
<p>Q4: Is X environment supported?</p>
<p>A4: Currently there is no plan to support.</p>
<p>Q5: How much extra memory is consumed?</p>
<p>A5: Fixed part (code and data in the kernel) is about 80 KB, variant part (access permissions) is a few hundred KB.</p>
<p>Q6: How large is the performance loss?</p>
<p>A4: Not tested formally, but users won't recognize.</p>
<p>Q7: Which kernel versions are supported?</p>
<p>A7: 2.4.30 and later and 2.6.11 and later downloadable from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">https://www.kernel.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Q8: Is it possible to support patched kernels from distributors?</p>
<p>A8: Yes, if you manually inserts hooks.</p>
<p>Q9: What is the license?</p>
<p>A9: It is GPL.</p>
<p>Q10: Does TOMOYO Linux have any usage other than Mandatory Access Control?</p>
<p>A10: You can create custom filesystem images with minimum files.</p>

<h2><a name="management">Policy Management</a></h2>
<p>Q1: Is the policy syntax easy?</p>
<p>A1: Yes, it's very easy.</p>
<p>Q2: Can I update policies dynamically?</p>
<p>A2: Yes, but memory used by old policies are not freed.</p>
<p>Q3: Will processes referring old policies crash by updating policies?</p>
<p>A3: No, processes won't crash because the old policies remains in the kernel.</p>
<p>Q4: Do I need to restart processes after updating policies?</p>
<p>A4: No, processes will automatically refer new policies.</p>
<p>Q5: What measures against tampering policies are there?</p>
<p>A5: Restrict programs that can modify policies, and restrict domains that can execute programs that can modify policies.</p>
<p>Q6: What is domain?</p>
<p>A6: The domain in TOMOYO Linux is a history of process execution.</p>
<p>Q7: How can I edit policies?</p>
<p>A7: CUI editors are included. You may use arbitrary text editors.</p>
<p>Q8: What is "ACCEPT mode"?</p>
<p>A8: A mode that access permissions are appended automatically.</p>
<p>Q9: Aren't there problems appending access permissions automatically?</p>
<p>A9: Almost no problem, for TOMOYO Linux uses absolute pathnames and fine-grained domain divisions.</p>
<p>Q10: Can I update packages while the Mandatory Access Control is enabled?</p>
<p>A10: Please do it in the "trusted domain", which Mandatory Access Control for domains is not applied.</p>
<p>Q11: Can I protect only daemon processes like SELinux's Targeted Policy?</p>
<p>A11: Yes.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Q1: What is the security model of TOMOYO Linux?</p>
<p>A1: Only DTE.</p>
<p>Q2: Are there concepts of users and roles?</p>
<p>A2: No, but it's possible to delegate a part of administration tasks.</p>
<p>Q3: Are patching to userland applications required?</p>
<p>A3: No.</p>
<p>Q4: TOMOYO Linux can't protect sshd from exploit codes, can it?</p>
<p>A4: No, but it's possible to countermeasure illegal logins by enforcing additional authentication.</p>
<p>Q5: Which division is TOMOYO Linux categorized in TCSEC?</p>
<p>A5: I don't know.</p>
<p>Q6: What security labels does TOMOYO Linux use?</p>
<p>A6: TOMOYO Linux uses absolute pathnames as security labels.</p>
<p>Q7: Can I use wildcards for pathnames?</p>
<p>A7: Yes.</p>
<p>Q8: Is MLS supported?</p>
<p>A8: No. Save in the different directories according to sensitivity level of the file.</p>
<p>Q9: Are there functions like LIDS's stateful ACL?</p>
<p>A9: No.</p>
<p>Q10: Is the correctness of security labels guaranteed?</p>
<p>A10: Since pathnames are used as security labels, the correctness of security labels is guaranteed unless the directory entry get corrupted.</p>
<p>Q11: Are resources other than files are protected?</p>
<p>A11: TOMOYO Linux supports network ports, signal transmissions, capability etc.</p>
<p>Q12: Are device files protected from being tampered with?</p>
<p>A12: You can use tamper-proof /dev filesystem.</p>
<p>Q13: Are there other functions?</p>
<p>A13: TOMOYO Linux can restrict operations that affect the system wide.</p>
<p>Q14: Why not use LSM?</p>
<p>A14: I can't, for current specification of LSM doesn't pass parameters that TOMOYO Linux needs.</p>
