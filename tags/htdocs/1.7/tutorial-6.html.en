<h1>The world of TOMOYO Linux<br>The sixth installment: "Let's eradicate illegal logins."</h1>

<h2>Contents of this installment.</h2>

<p>By using secure OS, you can forbid accessing to resources which are not needed for providing services. Therefore, you can reduce damages when control of process was hijacked by exploiting buffer overflow vulnerability.</p>

<p>Then, what about login sessions of users who passed proper procedure (login authentication)? Needless to say, proper administrators have to be able to administrate the system as they intend. Then, secure OS cannot reduce damage if intruder passed login authentication. Therefore, the question is, how to reinforce login authentication while allowing proper administrators to operate what they need to do.</p>

<p>In TOMOYO Linux, you can reduce damages even if intruder passed login authentication, by utilizing TOMOYO Linux's domain authentication. In this installment, I explain steps for deploying illegal login buster system at no fee and steps for splitting administrator's jobs.</p>

<h2>About illegal login buster system</h2>

<h3>I want to prevent my systems from being used as steppingstone!</h3>

<p>Illegal logins against SSH services by password brute force attacks are increasing. As a result of illegal logins, systems are used as phishing sites or are installed malicious programs for attacking other hosts.</p>

<p>It is possible to install and execute malicious programs without administrator's privileges. You cannot say that "I don't care illegal logins to this server because there is no secret information on this server" or "No problem unless logged in as "root" user". When you become a victim, servers connected to the Internet make you of the victimizer at the same time. Thus, it is important to take precautions.</p>

<h3>I want to protect sensitive information!</h3>

<p>All Linux/UNIX systems support login authentication. There are means to reinforce login authentication such as PAM ( Pluggable Authentication Modules ) or public key authentication, but the concept of login authentication are basically identical. It is a question that it is appropriate thing to apply same authentication for personal-use servers and enterprise-use servers.</p>

<p>Don't you wish that you can apply login authentication depending on the intended use with appropriate level for that use? Hopefully without paying additional fee? TOMOYO Linux will provide a solution.</p>

<h3>Is it possible to enforce login authentication for multiple times?</h3>

<p>Regarding conventional countermeasure for illegal logins assumed that "We can do login authentication for only once. Thus, give up if ran through." Therefore, to realize as-safe-as-possible login authentication in the only one chance, public key authentications and biometrics authentications are getting introduced. Secure OS cannot solve this limitation.</p>

<p>However, TOMOYO Linux can solve this limitation. TOMOYO Linux realizes "We can do login authentication for as many times as we want. Thus, no need to worry for being run through." Therefore, you can use conventional login authentication  for preventing illegal logins.</p>

<h3>Why it is possible to enforce for multiple times?</h3>

<p>TOMOYO Linux is not equipped with dedicated login authentication mechanisms. But you can reinforce login authentication by utilizing mandatory access control based on domain transition tree which I explained by now in this series.</p>

<p>By using TOMOYO Linux, you can very easily limit operations after login authentication to only "execute a program which performs additional user authentication". What is wonderful with this approach is that there is no limitation for available algorithm for the program which performs additional user authentication and is no need to follow internationally authorized standards, for the program is running on SSH server and protocol is handled by SSH service.</p>

<p>The only requirement for the program which performs additional user authentication is that the program executes next program (usually a shell program) when all conditions are met. The program cannot be bypassed because access to resources which are not permitted by policy is forbidden by mandatory access control.</p>

<p>For example, you can use a simple script like Fig. 1. You might think that "It makes no sense to embed password into the script file because everyone can read the script file.", but by using mandatory access control, you can make the contents of the script file unreadable. (If you are still worried, you can cut password out to external files or write the program using C language.)</p>

<p>I explain using a script program listed in Fig.1 as an example of reinforcement. Save the program listed in Fig. 1 as /bin/auth1 and make it executable by "chmod 755 /bin/auth1". Note that this program is just an example. When you apply on the real systems, please make programs using your favorite algorithms. More alien authentication methods, more difficult to run through the protection.</p>

<h3>Let's install</h3>

<p>I explain how to protect servers which provide SSH logins as an example. I assume /bin/bash is specified as login shells.</p>

<h4>&diams;Preparation</h4>

<p>Apply mandatory access control on "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash" domain (a domain for login shell logged in via /usr/sbin/sshd ) and make the domain to allow only execution of programs permitted by policy configuration. (Note that if you don't apply mandatory access control on "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd" domain (a domain for /usr/sbin/sshd ), this restriction will be bypassed by executing other programs (e.g. /bin/tcsh ) from /usr/sbin/sshd .)</p>

<p>Firstly, make sure that "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash" domain is not specified using keep_domain keyword. ( keep_domain keyword is explained in the third installment of this series.) If "keep_domain &lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash" is specified, delete the entry using policy editor.</p>

<p>Also, if you don't apply mandatory access control on "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth1 /bin/bash" domain (a domain for shell after passing additional authentication) and its descendent domains, you can add "keep_domain &lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth1 /bin/bash" using policy editor because you don't need to transit domains. (Fig. 2)</p>

<h4>&diams;Learning</h4>

<p>In the second installment of this series, we defined profiles listed in Fig. 3. Thus, I use these profiles for this installment. Change domains for login shells logged via /usr/sbin/sshd to learning mode. Run commands listed in Fig. 4 from console.</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">
<tr><td>
&diams; Fig. 3&nbsp;&nbsp;Profile for this installment<br>

PREFERENCE::permissive={ verbose=yes }
PREFERENCE::enforcing={ verbose=yes }

<pre>
# /usr/sbin/ccs-setprofile -r 1 '&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash'
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Login via /usr/sbin/sshd and execute /bin/auth1 . You are prompted for a password. Thus, enter "SAKURA" and press "Enter" key. The authentication will succeed and /bin/bash (which is set to environment variable SHELL ) is executed. (Fig. 5)</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">

</table>

<p>Now, permissions for performing additional authentication were learned. Type "exit" for twice to logout from /usr/sbin/sshd .</p>

<h4>&diams;Verify and enforce</h4>

<p>Change "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash" domain and its descendent domains to permissive mode, "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth1 /bin/bash" domain and its descendent domains to disabled mode. Run commands listed in Fig. 6 from console.</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">

# /usr/sbin/ccs-setprofile -r 0 '&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth1 /bin/bash'
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>At this state, login via /usr/sbin/sshd and execute /bin/auth1 . Check that error messages are not printed. Then, change "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash" domain and its descendent domains to enforcing mode, "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth1 /bin/bash" domain and its descendent domains to disabled mode. Run commands listed in Fig. 7 from console.</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">

&diams; Fig. 7&nbsp;&nbsp;Change "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash" domain and its descendent domains to enforcing mode, "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth1 /bin/bash" domain and its descendent domains to disabled mode
<pre>
# /usr/sbin/ccs-setprofile -r 3 '&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash'
# /usr/sbin/ccs-setprofile -r 0 '&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth1 /bin/bash'
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You've finished installation. Don't you think it is easy?</p>

<h4>&diams;Let's pretend an attacker</h4>

<p>Let's test the power of this system by assuming that an intruder succeeded to login by password brute force attack or without login authentication by attacking buffer overflow vulnerability. (Fig. 8)</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">
<tr><td>
&diams; Fig. 8&nbsp;&nbsp;All commands except auth1 command are rejected
<pre>
Last login: Tue Feb 27 17:12:10 2007
# whoami
-bash: /usr/bin/whoami: Operation not permitted
# /bin/auth1
Password: password
Password: root
Password: guest
Incorrect password.
# exec 4&lt;/bin/auth1; while read -u 4; do echo $REPLY; done
-bash: /bin/auth1: Operation not permitted
-bash: read: 4: invalid file descriptor: Bad file descriptor
# exit
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The intruder succeeded to login via /usr/sbin/sshd , but the intruder does not know what operations are permitted (because the intruder cannot execute commands for reading the policy configuration). Any commands the intruder attempted to execute randomly are denied, except the auth1 command. If the intruder did not know about secure OS, the intruder will be surprised.</p>

<p>The intruder after all goes away. Even if the intruder found that the intruder can execute /bin/auth1 command, the intruder cannot know what the /bin/auth1 is doing because the intruder cannot read the script. (WARNING: Note that regarding shell script programs, if environment variable "SHELLOPS" is set to "verbose:noexec", the contents of the script file will be printed by executing /bin/auth1 command. Thus, when you install this system on real systems, I recommend you to write programs using programming languages that won't be affected by environment variables.) Therefore, the intruder has to go away.</p>

<p>The legal user knows what operations are permitted. Thus, the legal user immediately executes /bin/auth1 command and proceeds by entering correct password. (Fig. 9)</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">
<tr><td>
&diams; Fig. 9&nbsp;&nbsp;Execute /bin/auth1 and enter correct password

# whoami

# exec 4&lt;/bin/auth1; while read -u 4; do echo $REPLY; done
#! /bin/sh
for i in 1 2 3
do
  echo -n 'Password: '
  read -r -s passwd
  echo
  [ "$passwd" = "SAKURA" ] &amp;&amp; exec $SHELL
done
echo 'Incorrect password.'
#
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you think it is insufficient to use only /bin/auth1 , you can create /bin/auth2 and /bin/auth3 , and install these programs in serial direction. And you can assign a profile for disabled mode to "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth1 /bin/bash /bin/auth2 /bin/bash /bin/auth3 /bin/bash" domain. TOMOYO Linux's domain transition is useful when describing hierarchical processing procedure.</p>

<h3>Cases where this approach cannot be applied</h3>

<p>The protection I explained above are applicable for cases like SSH login or Telnet login (where mapping of process and user is persistent and a shell program which allows execution of arbitrary commands are provided). The protection is not applicable for cases like HTTP login (where TCP connections are disconnected every time) or FTP login (where a shell program is not provided).</p>

<p>To apply this approach to the programs which are directly executed from login shell (e.g. scp command and sftp command), you can use execute_handler feature which TOMOYO Linux provides. (I explain about execute_handler at the bottom of this installment.) Also, you can restrict accessible resources by these programs by using mandatory access control which secure OS provides. For example, you can allow these programs to access files under "scp" directory of user's home directory. Since scp command and sftp command are directly executed from login shells, domains for these programs will be "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /usr/bin/scp" and "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server". The roughly written policy configuration for these domains will look like Fig. 10. (Files like library files are omitted in Fig. 10.)</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">
<tr><td>
&diams; Fig. 10&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy configuration for scp command<br>

allow_read/write /home/\*/scp/\*
allow_read/write /home/\*/scp/\{\*\}/\*
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>By defining pathname groups using "path_group" keyword in exception policy like Fig. 11, you can simply describe in domain policy like Fig. 12.</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">
<tr><td>
&diams; Fig. 11&nbsp;&nbsp;Grouping files for scp command<br>

</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You can add conditions like "if path1.uid=task.uid" as needed.</p>

<p>SSH encrypts data on communication channel, but SSH does not encrypt files on filesystems. For more security, by encrypting files to be transferred via scp command or sftp command using gpg command, you can protect files on directories accessed by scp command or sftp command even if SSH login authentication was run through.</p>

<h2>About dividing administrator's privileges</h2>

<h3>Conventional approach</h3>

<p>Conventional approach is implemented in the application layer (e.g. restricting commands to be executed using sudo command). But implementation on application layer has been annoying administrators because sometimes bypassed by e.g. OS command injection vulnerability.</p>

<h3>New approach based on secure OS</h3>

<p>Many of secure OSes are equipped with RBAC ( Role Based Access Control ) functionality. By using RBAC, you can restrict execution of programs and read/write of files based on the role. RBAC is a useful feature for actual operations.</p>

<h3>Dividing privileges using TOMOYO Linux</h3>

<p>TOMOYO Linux is not equipped with dedicated RBAC mechanisms. But you can do access control similar to RBAC by utilizing mandatory access control based on domain transition tree.</p>

<p>In SELinux, roles are defined by grouping multiple domains and users are assigned roles. When a user needs to transit to different domain which is not included in the current role, the user changes roles which contain domains which the user wants to belong to.</p>

<p>TOMOYO Linux does not have the concept of "role". However, the "domain" itself corresponds with "role" of the moment. (Thus, you don't need to aware "role" in TOMOYO Linux.) Assigning a domain means assigning a role at the same time.</p>

<h3>Let's install</h3>

<p>I explain how to delegate only management of WWW servers (e.g. restarting WWW server and updating WWW contents) to somebody else as an example. I assume /bin/bash is specified as login shells.</p>

<p>Steps for actually installing are already explained by now. Regarding illegal login buster system, you enforce additional authentication in serial direction. (Fig. 13) Regarding dividing administrator's privileges, you enforce additional authentication in parallel direction. (Fig. 14)</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Note that you need to assign a profile for enforcing mode (in this series, profile 3) to domains after additional authentication. If a user once reached a domain where a profile for non-enforcing mode is assigned, you can no longer restrict the user (i.e. you can no longer divide administrator's privileges).</p>

<h4>&diams;Preparation</h4>

<p>First, make sure that "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash" domain is not specified using "keep_domain" keyword. Also, specify "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth1 /bin/bash" domain (a domain after passing additional authentication by /bin/auth1 ) and "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth2 /bin/bash" domain (a domain after passing additional authentication by /bin/auth2 ) using "keep_domain" keyword.</p>

<p>I assume /bin/auth1 for being used for authenticating yourself with full privileges and /bin/auth2 for being used for authenticating someone with only privileges for managing WWW servers.</p>

<h4>&diams;Learning</h4>

<p>Steps for learning are the same with illegal login buster system.</p>

<p>Run commands listed in Fig. 15 from console.</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">
<tr><td>
&diams; Fig. 15&nbsp;&nbsp;Change "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash" and its descendent domains to learning mode

</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>At this state, login via /usr/sbin/sshd and execute /bin/auth1 and /bin/auth2 respectively. When you pass the authentication, "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth1 /bin/bash" domain and "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth2 /bin/bash" are created and necessary permissions are learned.</p>

<p>Then, change "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash" domain and its descendent domains to enforcing mode, "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth1 /bin/bash" domain and its descendent domains to disabled mode, "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth2 /bin/bash" domain and its descendent domains to learning mode. Run commands listed in Fig. 16 from console.</p>

# /usr/sbin/ccs-setprofile -r 1 '&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth2 /bin/bash'
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>At this state, login via /usr/sbin/sshd and execute /bin/auth2 . When you pass the authentication, you will reach "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth2 /bin/bash" domain. This domain does not create descendent domains because this domain is specified using "keep_domain" keyword.</p>

<p>Now, let TOMOYO Linux learn permissions needed for restarting WWW server. (Fig. 17)</p>

<p>You may want more. Also, you may want to patternize pathnames. Steps for patternizing pathnames are explained in the second installment of this series.</p>

<h4>&diams;Verify and enforce</h4>

<p>Make sure that you have enough permission for doing operations you want to allow. Change "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash /bin/auth2 /bin/bash" domain to permissive mode. Run commands listed in Fig. 20 from console.</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">

<p>After you verified that all necessary permissions are given, change to enforcing mode.  Run commands listed in Fig. 21 from console.  You've finished installation. Although you need to let TOMOYO Linux learn permissions needed for operations, it does not need so much time. It is powerful.</p>

<h2>Advanced usage</h2>

<p>In the last of this installment, I introduce some Tips.</p>

<h3>Login shell</h3>

<p>Shell programs which are used as login shell (e.g. /bin/bash ) have a plenty set of built-in commands. For example, administrator can do evil things like forcibly terminating arbitrary processes using built-in "kill" command (if you don't enable restriction by CONFIG::ipc::signal , I explain CONFIG::ipc::signal in the next installment).</p>

<p>To prevent administrator from doing evil things, you can use falsh command which in included in TOMOYO Linux's tools package for login shells. (Fig. 22)</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">
<tr><td>
&diams; Fig. 22&nbsp;&nbsp;Move falsh command to under /bin/ directory
<pre>
# mv /usr/lib/ccs/misc/falsh /bin/
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To change login shell to /bin/falsh , run commands listed in Fig. 23.</p>

<table border="1" summary="fig">
<tr><td>
&diams; Fig. 23&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing login shell to /bin/falsh
<pre>
# usermod -s /bin/falsh root
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Restricting networking for server process</h3>

<p>/usr/sbin/sshd has an ability to relay TCP connections (e.g. port forwarding). By enabling restriction by CONFIG::network (which I explain in the next installment) to "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd" domain (a domain for /usr/sbin/sshd program), you can do stronger protection.</p>

<p>If a server program need not to establish TCP connections from server to client, by enabling restriction by CONFIG::network , you can prevent such program from being abused by worms and viruses as steppingstone for attacking other servers.</p>

<p>If you are sure that specific functionality is not needed for specific service, it worth to explicitly deny use of such functionality using mandatory access control's policy configuration.</p>

<h3>Batched processing using public key authentication</h3>

<p>If you are using batched processing which will automatically login via /usr/sbin/sshd using public key authentication, the approach I explained in this installment is useful.</p>

<p>You can divide domains like "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash" domain and "&lt;kernel&gt; /usr/sbin/sshd /bin/tcsh" domain by simply assigning different login shells for the account for batched processing (for example, /bin/tcsh ) and the account for interactive processing (in this series, /bin/bash ). (Fig. 24)</p>
