<td>A pathname that begins with "/" and contain neither symbolic links, "/./", "//" nor "/../" . (There is one exception. Process information directory for current process that is accessible via "/proc/self/" directory is represented as is.)<br>
Even if a process is running under chroot'ed environment, Canonicalized Pathname is calculated from outside the chroot'ed environment.<br>
Canonicalized Pathname contains only ASCII printable range (from 0x21 to 0x7E) characters. Thus, "\" character (0x5C) itself is represented as "\\", and all other non-printable characters (from 0x01 to 0x20, from 0x7F to 0xFF) are represented using octal expressions("\ooo") (for example, the space character (0x20) is represented as "\040").</td>

<h2><a name="domain_and_transition">1.2 Domain definitions and Domain transitions rule</a></h2>
<p>In TOMOYO Linux, every process belongs to a single domain, and all PROGRAM belong to different domain.<br>
Even the two processes are executing the same PROGRAM, if their previous domains differ, they belong to different domain.</p>
<p>All domains are defined originating from "&lt;kernel&gt;" domain, which the kernel process belongs to.<br>
Since /sbin/init is invoked by the "&lt;kernel&gt;" domain, the domain for /sbin/init is defined as "&lt;kernel&gt; /sbin/init".<br>
Since /etc/rc.d/rc is invoked by /sbin/init invoked by the kernel, the domain for /etc/rc.d/rc is defined as "&lt;kernel&gt; /sbin/init /etc/rc.d/rc".</p>
<p>There are some PROGRAMs that behave differently depending on the invocation name.<br>
For example, /sbin/pidof is a symbolic link to /sbin/killall5 .<br>
Since TOMOYO Linux uses Canonicalized Pathname, if /sbin/pidof is executed, the domain is defined as if /sbin/killall5 is executed.</p>
<p>When a process tries to execute a PROGRAM, the following steps are performed.</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>Step</td><td>Procedure</td></tr>
<tr><td>Getting program's name</td><td>
<p>Get the name of PROGRAM that the process is going to execute and keep it as "Candidate 1". This procedure dereferences if the program is a symbolic link.</p>

<h2><a name="system_policy.conf">2.3 System policy (system_policy.conf)</a></h2>
<p>This file contains permissions that apply to the entire system. The following 4 types of permissions are declared.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mount permission</li>
<li>Directories that don't allow to be unmounted</li>
<li>Directories that are allowed to chroot to</li>
<li>Directories that are allowed to exchange</li>
<li>Local ports that don't allow to be bound automatically</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mount permission</h3>
<p>To grant mount permission, use allow_mount directive followed by "$devicefile $mountpoint $filesystem $options".<br>
The $devicefile need to be a Canonicalized File if the $filesystem requires device file.<br>
The $mountpoint must be a Canonicalized Directory.<br>
The $options is an integer expression.</p>

<p>To grant "mount -o remount $mountpoint" permission, use allow_mount directive followed by "any $mountpoint --remount $options".</p>

<p>To grant "mount --bind $source_dir $dest_dir" and "mount --move $source_dir $dest_dir" permission, use allow_mount directive followed by "$source_dir $dest_dir --bind $options" and "$source_dir $dest_dir --move $options" respectively. The $source_dir and $dest_dir must be Canonicalized Directory.</p>

<p>Kernel 2.6.15 and later supports "Shared Subtree" functionality.<br>
To grant "mount --make-unbindable $mountpoint" permission, use allow_mount directive followed by "any $mountpoint --make-unbindable $options".<br>
To grant "mount --make-private $mountpoint" permission, use allow_mount directive followed by "any $mountpoint --make-private $options".<br>
To grant "mount --make-slave $mountpoint" permission, use allow_mount directive followed by "any $mountpoint --make-slave $options".<br>
To grant "mount --make-shared $mountpoint" permission, use allow_mount directive followed by "any $mountpoint --make-shared $options".
</p>
<h3>Directories that don't allow to be unmounted</h3>
<p>To reject unmount request, use deny_unmount directive followed by a Canonicalized Directory.</p>
<p>Usually, specify /dev/ directory (that contains /dev/tty? used by /sbin/mingetty) and /dev/pts/ directory (that are used to create pty device files for remote login).</p>
<p>If /dev/ becomes read-only or /dev/pts/ is unmounted, you can't login to the system.<br>
Therefore /dev/ and /dev/pts/ must not be unmounted for systems where / is read-only.</p>
<h3>Directories that are allowed to chroot to</h3>
<p>To grant chroot permission, use allow_chroot directive followed by a Canonicalized Directory.</p>
<p>Usually, grant /var/empty/sshd/ that sshd uses.<br>
In addition, if you have applications that runs in the chroot'ed environment or applications that uses chroot (for example, /usr/share/empty/ is used by vsftpd), grant such directories too.</p>
<h3>Directories that are allowed to exchange</h3>
<p>To grant pivot_root permission, use allow_pivot_root directive followed by the new root's Canonicalized Directory and the previous root's Canonicalized Directory.</p>
<p>Usually, you don't need this directive.</p>
<h3>Local ports that don't allow to be bound automatically</h3>
<p>To prevent specific local port from being selected automatically, use deny_autobind directive followed by local port number.</p>
<p>This directive is intended to prevent specific local port from being bound for temporary use.<br>
For example, some proxy server uses local port 8080, so port 8080 should not be bound by other PROGRAMs for temporary use.</p>

<h2><a name="domain_policy.conf">2.4 Domain policy (domain_policy.conf)</a></h2>
<p>This file contains permissions that apply to domain. The following 5 types of permissions are declared.</p>

<li>MAC for argv[0]</li>
<li>MAC for capabilities</li>
<li>MAC for network addresses and ports</li>

</table>

<p>You may use wildcards for directives other than 1 3 5 and 7. You should avoid using directives 3 5 and 7 as hard as possible.</p>

<h3>MAC for argv[0]</h3>

<p>To restrict the contents of argv[0], use allow_argv0 directive followed by "the pathname of PROGRAM" and "the basename part of argv[0]".</p>

<p>The execve() system call, which is used to execute a program, accepts filename and argv[] and envp[]. Some programs (e.g. busybox) behave differently depending on the basename of argv[0].

When invoking a program via a symbolic link, the domain transition of TOMOYO Linux is done based on the Canonicalized Pathname of filename while the behavior of the program is determined based on argv[0] (usually same as filename).
For example, in a system that provides /bin/ls and /bin/cat as hard links of busybox, it becomes a loophole that allows
programs to behave as cat in the domain of /bin/ls by creating a symbolic link named /tmp/cat that points to /bin/ls and executing /tmp/cat .</p>
<p>The purpose of this directive is to restrict the combinations of filename and argv[0] so that such loopholes won't occur.</p>

<h3>MAC for capabilities</h3>
<p>To grant capability permission, use allow_capability directive followed by a capability.<br>
The following capabilities are applicable.</p>

<h3>MAC for networking addresses and ports</h3>
<p>To grant permission for ports, use allow_network directive followed by protocol(TCP or UDP or RAW) and IP address and port number (for TCP or UDP) / protocol number (for RAW). This permission is applicable to IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Directive</td><td>Granted Operation</td><td>Example</td></tr>
<tr><td>allow_network TCP bind</td><td>Bind to local TCP address/port.</td><td>allow_network TCP bind 0.0.0.0 80</td></tr>
<tr><td>allow_network TCP listen</td><td>Listen to local TCP address/port.</td><td>allow_network TCP listen 0.0.0.0 80</td></tr>

<tr><td>allow_network RAW connect</td><td>Communicate with remote IP address/protocol.</td><td>allow_network RAW connect 10.0.0.1 1</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Use of "::" for IPv6 address representation is not supported. You need to use "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" for "::1".</p>
<h3>MAC for signals</h3>
<p>To grant permissions for signals, use allow_signal directive followed by signal number and Target domain.</p>
<p>There are two exceptions. If signal number is 0, it is always granted. If the Target domain and the Source domain are the same, it is always granted.</p>
<p>In other cases, signals are granted only when the signal number matches and the Target domain starts with the Target domain declared with this directive.</p>
<p>If only &lt;kernel&gt; is declared as a Target domain, the Source domain can send signals to any domain with that signal number.</p>

<h3><a name="conditional_acl">Conditional permission</a></h3>

<p>TOMOYO Linux 1.2 supports conditional permission. The condition clause are appended to the tail of each permission using "if" directive.</p>

<p>"path1" corresponds to the first pathname of operations that requires pathnames, and "path2" corresponds to the second pathname of operations that requires pathnames. For example, the case of "allow_rename file1 file2", path1 corresponds to file1 and path2 corresponds to file2.</p>

<p>"path1.uid" and "path1.gid" are not available for pathnames that don't exist. Thus, you can't use when creating pathnames (such as allow_create directive).</p>

<p>"path1.parent.uid" and "path1.parent.gid" are always available.</p>

<p>"path2.parent.uid" and "path2.parent.gid" are available only for operations that require 2 pathnames (in other words, allow_link and allow_rename directives).</p>

<p>"path2.uid" and "path2.gid" are not supported. ( If "path2" already exist for "rename" operation, "unlink" or "rmdir" operation is performed implicitly.)</p>

<p>Neither "path1" nor "path2" are supported when accessing via "sysctl" ( i.e. accessing files under /proc/sys/ directories using "sysctl" instead for "open")</p>

<h2><a name="exception_policy.conf">2.5 Exception policy (exception_policy.conf)</a></h2>
<p>This file contains exceptions for domain access controls. The following 10 types of permissions are declared.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pathname pattern</li>
<li>Pathname group</li>
<li>Address group</li>
<li>Unconditionally readable files</li>
<li>Files that aren't rewritable by default</li>

<li>Programs that cause domain transition initialization</li>
<li>Programs that prevent domain transition initialization</li>
<li>Domains that prevent domain transition</li>
<li>Domains that cause domain transition</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pathname pattern</h3>

<p>To declare pathname pattern, use file_pattern directive followed by pathname pattern. The pathname pattern must be a Canonicalized Pathname. This directive is not applicable to neither granting execute permissions nor domain definitions.</p>
<p>For example, Canonicalized Pathname that contains a process ID (i.e. /proc/PID/ files) needs to be grouped in order to make access control work well.</p>
<p>The following wildcards are available.</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Value</td><td>Meaning</td></tr>
<tr><td>\\</td><td>\ itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>\*</td><td>Zero or more repetitions of characters other than '/'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>\@</td><td>Zero or more repetitions of characters other than '/' or '.'.</td></tr>

<tr><td>\X</td><td>One or more repetitions of hexadecimal digits.</td></tr>
<tr><td>\x</td><td>1 hexadecimal digit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>\A</td><td>One or more repetitions of alphabet characters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>\a</td><td>1 alphabet character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>\-</td><td>Pathname subtraction operator.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The usage of "\-" is shown below.</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>Expression</td><td>Meaning</td></tr>
<tr><td>/etc/\*</td><td>All files in /etc/ directory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>/etc/\*\-\*shadow\*</td><td>/etc/\* other than /etc/\*shadow\*</td></tr>
<tr><td>/\*\-proc\-sys/</td><td>/\*/ other than /proc/ /sys/</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Pathname group</h3>

<p>To declare pathname group, use path_group directive followed by name of the group and pathname pattern. For example, if you want to group all files under home directory, you can define</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>
path_group HOME-DIR-FILE /home/\*/\*<br>
path_group HOME-DIR-FILE /home/\*/\*/\*<br>
path_group HOME-DIR-FILE /home/\*/\*/\*/\*<br>
path_group HOME-DIR-FILE /home/\*/\*/\*/\*/\*<br>
path_group HOME-DIR-FILE /home/\*/\*/\*/\*/\*/\*<br>
path_group HOME-DIR-FILE /home/\*/\*/\*/\*/\*/\*/\*
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>in the exception policy and use like</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>
4 @HOME-DIR-FILE
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>to grant file access permission.</p>

<h3>Address group</h3>

<p>To declare address group, use address_group directive followed by name of the group and IP address pattern. For example, if you want to group all local addresses, you can define</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>
address_group local-address 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255<br>
address_group local-address 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255<br>
address_group local-address 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>in the exception policy and use like</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>
allow_network TCP accept @local-address 1024-65535
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>to grant network access permission.</p>

<h3>Unconditionally readable files</h3>

<p>To grant unconditionally readable permissions, use allow_read directive followed by Canonicalized File. This directive is intended to reduce size of <a href="#domain_policy.conf">Domain policy</a> by granting read access to library files such as GLIBC and locale files. You should not grant password files such as /etc/passwd, for all process can read if DAC is granted.</p>

<h3>Files that aren't rewritable by default</h3>

<p>To deny overwriting already written contents of file (such as log files) by default, use deny_rewrite directive followed by pathname pattern. Files whose pathname match to the patterns are not permitted to open for writing without append mode or truncate unless the pathnames are explicitly granted using allow_rewrite directive in domain policy.</p>

<h3>Programs invocable via symbolic links</h3>

<p>To allow executing programs using the name of symbolic links, use alias directive followed by dereferenced pathname and reference pathname. This directive is intended to allow programs that behave differently depending on the name of invocation and that referenced using symbolic links instead of hard links transit domain using the symbolic link's name.</p>
<p>For example, /sbin/pidof is a symbolic link to /sbin/killall5 . In normal case, if /sbin/pidof is executed, the domain is defined as if /sbin/killall5 is executed. By specifying "alias /sbin/killall5 /sbin/pidof", you can run /sbin/pidof in the domain for /sbin/pidof .</p>

<h3>Program aggregations</h3>

<p>To deal multiple programs as a single program, use aggregator directive followed by name of original program and aggregated program. This directive is intended to aggregate similar programs.</p>
<p>For example, /usr/bin/tac and /bin/cat are similar. By specifying "aggregator /usr/bin/tac /bin/cat", you can run /usr/bin/tac in the domain for /bin/cat .</p>
<p>For example, /usr/sbin/logrotate for Fedora Core 3 generates programs like /tmp/logrotate.\?\?\?\?\?\? and run them, but TOMOYO Linux doesn't allow using patterns for granting execute permission and defining domains. By specifying "aggregator /tmp/logrotate.\?\?\?\?\?\? /tmp/logrotate.tmp", you can run /tmp/logrotate.\?\?\?\?\?\? as if /tmp/logrotate.tmp is running.</p>

<h3>Programs that cause domain transition initialization</h3>

<p>To initialize domain transition when specific PROGRAM is executed, use initialize_domain directive.</p>

<ul>
<li>initialize_domain "PROGRAM" from "DOMAIN"
<li>initialize_domain "PROGRAM" from "the last PROGRAM part of DOMAIN"
<li>initialize_domain "PROGRAM"
</ul>

<p>If the part "from" and after is not given, the entry is applied to all DOMAIN. If the "DOMAIN" doesn't start with "&lt;kernel&gt;", the entry is applied to all DOMAIN whose domainname ends with "the last PROGRAM part of DOMAIN".</p>

<p>This directive is intended to aggregate domain transitions for daemon PROGRAM and PROGRAM that are invoked by the kernel on demand, by transiting to different domain.</p>

<h3>Programs that prevent domain transition initialization</h3>

<p>To deny the effect of "initialize_domain" directive, use "no_initialize_domain" directive.</p>

<ul>
<li>no_initialize_domain "PROGRAM" from "DOMAIN"
<li>no_initialize_domain "PROGRAM" from "the last PROGRAM part of DOMAIN"
<li>no_initialize_domain "PROGRAM"
</ul>

<p>Use this directive when you don't want to initialize domain transition.</p>

<h3>Domains that prevent domain transition</h3>

<p>To prevent domain transition when PROGRAM is executed from specific DOMAIN, use keep_domain directive.</p>

<ul>
<li>keep_domain "PROGRAM" from "DOMAIN"
<li>keep_domain "PROGRAM" from "the last PROGRAM part of DOMAIN"
<li>keep_domain "DOMAIN"
<li>keep_domain "the last PROGRAM part of DOMAIN"
</ul>

<p>If the part "from" and before is not given, this entry is applied to all PROGRAM. If the "DOMAIN" doesn't start with "&lt;kernel&gt;", the entry is applied to all DOMAIN whose domainname ends with "the last PROGRAM part of DOMAIN".</p>

<p>This directive is intended to reduce total number of domains and memory usage by suppressing unneeded domain transitions.</p>

<p>To declare domain keepers, use keep_domain directive followed by domain definition. </p>
<p>Any process that belongs to any domain declared with this directive, the process stays at the same domain unless any program registered with initialize_domain directive is executed.</p>

<h3>Domains that cause domain transition</h3>

<p>To deny the effect of "keep_domain" directive, use "no_keep_domain" directive.</p>

<ul>
<li>no_keep_domain "PROGRAM" from "DOMAIN"
<li>no_keep_domain "PROGRAM" from "the last PROGRAM part of DOMAIN"
<li>no_keep_domain "DOMAIN"
<li>no_keep_domain "the last PROGRAM part of DOMAIN"
</ul>

<p>Use this directive when you want to escape from a DOMAIN that is kept by "keep_domain" directive.</p>
