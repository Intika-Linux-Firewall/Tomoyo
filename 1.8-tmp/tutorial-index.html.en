<h1>TOMOYO Linux 1.8.x : The world of TOMOYO Linux</h1>
<table border="0" summary="What is TOMOYO Linux?">
<tr><td><img src="../tomoyo.png" alt="tomoyo.png" width="115" height="150"></td><td>TOMOYO Linux is a security module which focuses on the behavior of a system. Every process is created to achieve a purpose, and TOMOYO Linux lets each process declare behaviors and resources needed to achieve their purpose (like an immigration officer). When configured to restrict access, TOMOYO Linux restricts each process to only these declared behaviors and resources (like an operation watchdog). This approach makes it possible for users to understand how a Linux system works. You can use TOMOYO Linux as a system analysis tool as well as an access restriction tool.</td></tr>

<h2>Introduction to this tutorial</h2>

<p>This tutorial aims to provide an informative set of instructions on how to use TOMOYO Linux, allowing the reader to experience and master the tools involved in securing a system. This tutorial is designed to be much more comprehensive than the <a href="index.html.en">short guide</a> and can be used instead of the short guide, or as a supplement to it. The tutorial has been split into a number of chapters, which are outlined below. For those using this project for system restriction, the first X chapters are relevant. For those using this project for system restriction, the whole tutorial should provide a solid foundation from which a policy of least privilege can be developed for any particular system. The Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provided by this project is not designed to offer protection "out of the box", but instead requires time and an understanding of the concepts and tools involved. It is therefore extremely worthwhile to read this tutorial and develop a thorough understanding. Only then can you ensure that your system is as secure as possible.</p>
