ccs-findtemp - detect temporary pathnames in TOMOYO Linux policy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program reads a list of pathnames from standard input and checks the existence of these pathnames. Non-existent pathnames are likely to be temporary files and so are printed to standard output. This program can be used alongside wildcard expression rules to shorten and simplify policy.
