=head1 NAME

ccs-editpolicy-agent - agent for remotely editing TOMOYO Linux policy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ccs-editpolicy-agent> I<listen_ip:listen_port>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is an agent for B<ccs-editpolicy>, B<ccs-loadpolicy>, B<ccs-savepolicy>, B<ccs-pstree>, B<ccs-queryd>, and B<ccs-auditd>.

It listens on the specified IP address at the specified port.

Do not run this program unless you know what you are doing. It allows anonymous users to edit policy, as no user authentication is performed. It is designed for systems with resource limitations that make it difficult to run the TOMOYO Linux userspace tools. Do not use this for normal desktops or servers.

Before this program can be invoked, you must register it in F</proc/ccs/manager>.
