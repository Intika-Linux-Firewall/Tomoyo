Usage: ccs-init

This program is automatically called to load policy from files into kernel when /sbin/init starts.

This program copies the following files.

   /etc/ccs/system_policy.base + /etc/ccs/system_policy.conf => /proc/ccs/system_policy

   /etc/ccs/exception_policy.base + /etc/ccs/exception_policy.conf => /proc/ccs/exception_policy

   /etc/ccs/domain_policy.base + /etc/ccs/domain_policy.conf => /proc/ccs/domain_policy

   /etc/ccs/profile.base + /etc/ccs/profile.conf => /proc/ccs/profile

   /etc/ccs/manager.base + /etc/ccs/manager.conf => /proc/ccs/manager

   /etc/ccs/meminfo.base + /etc/ccs/meminfo.conf => /proc/ccs/meminfo

If /etc/ccs/ccs-post-init is an executable file, /etc/ccs/ccs-post-init is also executed.
You can use /etc/ccs/ccs-post-init for additional initialization purpose.
For example, you can write

  #! /bin/sh

  echo manage_by_non_root > /proc/ccs/manager

  chown -R demo /proc/ccs/

in the /etc/ccs/ccs-post-init and chown/chmod like

  chown -R demo /etc/ccs/

  chmod 755 /usr/lib/ccs/

to allow policy management by user "demo" as well as user "root".

Examples:

None.

[NOTES]

 If something went wrong, a prompt is shown so that the administrator can take action before the kernel gets panic.

 You don't need to invoke this program manually.

 To load policy after /sbin/init starts, use ccs-loadpolicy instead.
