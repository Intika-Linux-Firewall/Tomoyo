TOMOYO Linux is a pathname-based MAC extension (LSM module) for the 
Linux kernel.

This patchset is for mmotm (2008-11-19-02-19).

How to try:
1. Compile kernel with CONFIG_SECURITY_TOMOYO=y.
2. 'make' and 'make install' userspace tools (ccs-tools) available at 
   http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.jp/tomoyo/30298/ .
3. Run /usr/lib/ccs/tomoyo_init_policy.sh .
4. Run following commands to set learning-mode as default.
   (This step is optional but recommended on your first try.)
   # echo '<kernel>' > /etc/tomoyo/domain_policy.conf
   # echo 'use_profile 1' >> /etc/tomoyo/domain_policy.conf
4. Reboot.
   (If you compiled kernel with CONFIG_SECURITY_{SELINUX,SMACK}=y,
    add 'security=tomoyo' to kernel cmdline.)

Run ccs-editpolicy to browse and edit policy. LiveCD-based tutorials 
are available at
http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/en/1.6.x/1st-step/ubuntu8.04-live/
http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/en/1.6.x/1st-step/centos5-live/ .
Though these tutorials use non-LSM version of TOMOYO, they are useful 
for you to know what TOMOYO is.
